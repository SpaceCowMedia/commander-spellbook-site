const INTRODUCTION = `
You can use a variety of parameters to search the combo database.
No matter what parameter is used, capitalization will be disregarded, so a search of \`CARD:"BREATH OF" COLORIDENTITY:TEMUR RESULT:INFINITE\` is equivalent to \`card:"breath of" coloridentity:temur result:infinite\`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can prefix a \`-\` to any search term to negate it, excluding all matching combos from the search result.
> For example, \`-card:" "\` will exclude all combos with a card whose name contains a space.

> [!TIP]
> You can prefix a \`all-\` or \`@\` to some search terms to require that all related entities (cards, templates or results) match the search term.
> For example, \`all-cards:dragon\` or \`@card:dragon\` will only return combos where all cards contain the word "dragon" in the name.
> You can negate it with \`-all-cards:dragon\` or \`-@card:dragon\` to exclude all combos where all cards contain the word "dragon" in the name.
`;

const CARDS_DESCRIPTION = `
Type card names or parts of card names directly into the search bar to find combos that use those cards.
Writing a \`word\` in this way is equivalent to writing \`card:word\`.

> [!TIP]
> Accents and other diacritics are ignored; you can search for \`Deja Vu\` instead of \`DÃ©jÃ  Vu\`.

Put the card name inside double quotes (") to restrict the search to card names that include the entire phrase, including special characters and spaces.
For example, \`"Goblin King"\` will only find combos that contain the card Goblin King, while the search \`Goblin King\` without quotes will also find combos with both Goblin Bombardment and Darien, King of Kjeldor.
Writing \`"words with spaces"\` in this way is equivalent to writing \`card:"words with spaces"\`.

> [!TIP]
> Hyphens are also ignored, and can be removed or replaced by a single space.
> For example, \`card:"blade-blossom"\` is equivalent to \`card:"blade blossom"\` and \`card:"bladeblossom"\`

> [!TIP]
> Underscores are also ignored, and can be removed or replaced by a single space.
> For example, \`Fight the _____ Fight\` can be found with \`"Fight the _ Fight"\` or \`"Fight the Fight"\`

> [!WARNING]
> Single quotes are no longer supported in card search, since they can appear in card names.
> Instead, use double quotes. For example, \`"Goblin King"\` instead of \`'Goblin King'\`.
> Im the rare case where a card name contains double quotes, you can use the backslash character to escape them.
> For example, \`card:"Henzie \\"Toolbox\\" Torre"\`.

const COLOR_IDENTITY_DESCRIPTION = `
Each combo has a color identity determined by the color identities of its cards. This strictly follows Commander color identity rules.
By default, the color identity search finds all combos that a deck of that color identity could include. For example, \`coloridentity:bg\`
finds two-color black-green combos, but also monocolor black, monocolor green, and colorless combos.

The coloridentity parameter accepts full color names (such as \`green\`), single character abbreviations (\`w\`, \`u\`, \`b\`, \`r\`, \`g\`, and \`c\` for colorless),
and many color combination nicknames (\`boros\`, \`sultai\`, \`fivecolor\`, \`penta\`, etc.).

> [!NOTE]

const PREREQUISITES_DESCRIPTION = `
A combo's prerequisites describe the game state required to start the combo.
For example, \`prerequisites:text\`, searches for _text_ in the prerequisites of combos.

> [!WARNING]
> In most cases, this will _not_ search the text of the following "basic" prerequisites found in almost every combo:
> * Mana available
> * Starting card locations
> * Some starting card states (especially those that appear in the same line as the starting location, such as "Clone on the battlefield as a copy of Kiki-Jiki")

const TAG_DESCRIPTION = `
Combos are tagged based on certain features.
You can search these using \`is:tag\`, which is the only alias and operator supported.

### Supported tags

Some tags are manually added to variants, meaning their support is always a work in progress.
Other tags are applied automatically, so their support is complete and always up-to-date.

#### Automatic tags

* \`preview\`/\`previewed\`/\`spoiler\`/\`spoiled\`: the combo contains an unreleased card
* \`commander\`: the combo requires you to have a commander, so it will not work in most non-Commander formats
* \`featured\`: the combo appears in the feature page, which usually displays combos using cards from a recent or upcoming set
* \`reserved\`: the combo contains at least one card from the Reserved List
