    </p>

    <h4>Rights and Choices</h4>

    <p>
      The CCPA provides consumers located in the state of California with
      certain rights regarding their personal information and data. The
      following section describes those rights and explains how to exercise
      them:
    </p>

    <h4>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</h4>

    <p>
      You have the right to request that the company disclose certain
      information to you about our collection and use of your personal
      information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your
      verifiable consumer request (as described in the section “Exercising
      Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights”), we will disclose to you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
      <li>
        The categories of sources for the personal information we collected
        about you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that
        personal information.
      </li>
      <li>
        The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal
        information.
      </li>
      <li>
        The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also
        called data portability request)
      </li>
      <li>
        If we sold or disclose your personal information for a business purpose,
        two separate lists disclosing:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sales, identifying the personal information categories that each
            category of recipient purchased, and
          </li>
          <li>
            Disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal
            information categories that each category of recipient obtained
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Non-Discrimination</h4>

    <p>
      We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA
      rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
      <li>
        Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including
        through granting discounts or imposing penalties.
      </li>
      <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
      <li>
        Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or
        services or a different level of quality of goods or services.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to
      your value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material
      aspects.
    </p>
    <h4>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h4>
    <p>
      To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described
      above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by
      <a href="mailto:arthur@iOSConsultant.com">contacting us</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State
      that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer
      request related to your personal information. You may also make a
      verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access of data
      portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer
      request must:

        are the person about whom we collected personal information or an
        authorized representative.

      </li>

      if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and
      confirm the personal information relates to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an
      account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a
      verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or
      authority to make the request.
